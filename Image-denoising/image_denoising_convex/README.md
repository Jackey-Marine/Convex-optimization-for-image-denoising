# Image Denoising

In this experiment we test different image denoising techniques through the lens of convex optimization. Specifically, we test a quadratic filter, a total-variation filter, the non-local means approach, and the non-local weighted nuclear norm minimization approach. We benchmark these approaches against 5 images from the [University of Southern California&#39;s image database](https://sipi.usc.edu/database/database.php?volume=misc) (specifically aerial, boat, bridge, clock, and couple), when these images have been corrupted by additive zero-mean Gaussian noise and Poisson noise. Our [final report](image_denoising_report.pdf) explains in further detail our approach, the math behind it, and the references used.

### Install Mosek

Obtain [MOSEK&#39;s license](https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/) (free for academia).
Once you have received (via e-mail) and downloaded the license to your own `~/Downloads` folder, install it by executing

```
$ mkdir ~/mosek                                                    # Create MOSEK license folder in your home '~'
$ mv ~/Downloads/mosek.lic ~/mosek/                                # Copy the downloaded MOSEK license to '~/mosek/'
```

## Denoising Techniques

Consider a greyscale image Y. We are looking for a denoised image X. We have implemented the following techniques:

- **Quadratic Filtering:** Solve the optimization

  min`<sub>`X`</sub>` ||X - Y||`<sub>`sq`</sub>` + &lambda; ||&nabla;X||`<sub>`sq`</sub>`

  where ||X||`<sub>`sq`</sub>` is the sum-of-squares norm, and &nabla;X is the gradient of the image X.
- **Total Variation (TV) Filtering:** Solve the optimization

  min`<sub>`X`</sub>` ||X - Y||`<sub>`1`</sub>` + &lambda; ||X||`<sub>`TV`</sub>`

  where ||X||`<sub>`TV`</sub>` is the total-variation operator.
- **Non-Local Means (NLM) Filtering:** Denoising every pixel by making it a weighted average of every other pixel in the image, weighted by the similarity between the patches around the two pixels.
- **Non-Local Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (WNNM):** Finding similar patches to every patch in the image and using a weighted nuclear norm minimization to remove noisy singular values using a quadratic program.

## Optimization Techniques

Quadratic filtering and TV filtering are bicriteria optimizations since they have two different objectives. To solve this, we have implemented the primal-dual algorithm, and compared this approach with the out-of-the-box convex optimization provided by `<tt>`cvxpy`</tt>`.

## Testing

We compare the various approaches with additive white Gaussian noise (zero-mean but known variance) and Poisson noise (varying photon availability). We compare the efficacy of the approaches both qualitatively, and using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The original test images can be found in [images](images) and the pickled results and images can be found in [results](results).

The final results for additive white Gaussian noise are:
